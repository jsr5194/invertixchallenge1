RUNNING
-------

To run the game server, issue the command:
  twistd scram

This will start twistd, the Twisted daemon, acting as a gam3 server.
By default, it will run on TCP port 1337.  To load a terrain file, use
the --terrain option:
  twistd scram --terrain terrain/tiny.txt

To run the game client:
  ./bin/network-client localhost 1337

The network-client script assumes that the game source path is part of
Python's search path.  If you do not include the current directory in
your Python path by default, you will need to add it when running the
client.  For example, in a bash shell on Ubuntu:
  PYTHONPATH=. ./bin/network-client localhost 1337

Once the client is running, click inside the Pygame window and wave
the mouse up and down until you see terrain.  Use the W, A, S, D keys
to move around.  Click again to release the mouse.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

The game client and server depend on several packages.
 * Twisted - it's Twisted           <http://twistedmatrix.com/>
 * Pygame - SDL graphics and sound  <http://www.pygame.org/>
 * NumPy - numeric processing       <http://numpy.scipy.org/>
 * PyOpenGL - accelerated graphics  <http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/>
 * Epsilon - useful utility package <http://launchpad.net/divmod.org/>

These libraries are packaged for many operating systems.  For example, on
Debian/Ubuntu systems, you can install several of them with:
  sudo apt-get install python-twisted python-pygame python-numpy python-opengl

For unpackaged libraries, or on other platforms, you can install using
easy_install.  For information on how to get easy_install, see:
  http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html

To install each of the prerequisite packages, run easy_install with
the package name as its argument.  For example, to install Twisted:
  easy_install twisted
or, on UNIX-like systems:
  sudo easy_install twisted  # To install for all users.
